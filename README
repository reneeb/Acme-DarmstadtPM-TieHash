Acme::DarmstadtPM::TieHash
=================================

The Acme::DarmstadtPM::* namespace contains some modules from Darmstadt.pm.
The TieHash-module is a module that shows that you can do more or less everything
with Perl.

Ronnie Neumann sent a Ruby snippet to the Darmstadt.pm mailinglist and said that
this can't be done with Perl. I sat down and wrote this module to demonstrate
the abilities of Perl.
